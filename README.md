# Hello! Welcome to my first deployed web application.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About the Project

This project was created as part of my learning journey to explore and understand the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework for web development. It serves as an opportunity to:

- **Deepen my knowledge of Next.js**: By working on this project, I learned more about its features, such as server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and routing.
- **Refresh my skills in web development**: This project allowed me to revisit and strengthen my skills in both frontend and backend development, reinforcing concepts such as component-based design, API integration, and responsive UI.
- **Learn website deployment**: I explored how to deploy a web application using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), a platform that offers free and easy deployment solutions for Next.js projects.
